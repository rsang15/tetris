====================================================================


Version 1.2 (2003-01-30):
-------------------------

 o Changed figure rotation at the top of the board. Figures can now 
   be rotated, even though parts of them will end up outside the 
   board (topside).

 o Changed the figure introduction on the board to fall down one line 
   at a time, instead of making the full figure visible all at once. 
   If the whole figure cannot be introduced onto the board, the game
   ends.
   
 o Changed the default figure colors somewhat to make them more 
   different.

 o Changed the resize behaviour for the game component. Everything 
   now scales dynamically while keeping the aspect ratio. The font 
   sizes are also changed accordingly.

 o Added a speed level label just below the score label that displays 
   the current game speed.

 o Added a 'Paused' message on the board while the game is paused.

 o Added possibilty to rotate figures clockwise (with Shift pressed)
   or randomly (with Ctrl pressed).

 o Added properties and applet parameters to set most colors.

 o Added an Ant build file with automatic packaging. The compilation
   and packaging is now fully reproducible.

 o Added dummy MainBeanInfo and Main$COMClassObject classes in order
   to avoid problems with some versions of Internet Explorer 
   requesting these files by HTTP (which cause a HTTP 404 error).

 o Renamed the Java package from gnu.app.game.tetris to 
   net.percederberg.tetris. This has implications for scripts and
   <applet> declarations in web pages.

 o Improved code style. All the source code has been reindented to 
   use spaces instead of tabs, and various minor code style 
   improvements have been made in the source tree.
   
 o Refactored code in all classes and improved comments.


Version 1.1 (2000-09-22):
-------------------------

 o Second public release of this game.


Version 1.0 (?):
-------------------------

 o First public release of this game.
